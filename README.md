# Customized-Dice-Simulator
This is a Python project where I have designed a dice simulator but with a bit of customizations and variations.

Firstly, this has been designed for a 2 player game.

Secondly, there are two levels of difficulty mentioned, if the users choose "easy" then the probability for the dice to point to 6 will be the same as probability for the dice to point to 1. Now if the users choose "hard" then the probability for the dice to point to values of 4,5,6 will be way less than the probability of the dice to point to values of 1,2 and 3.
Go through the project to know more about this customized dice simulator.
